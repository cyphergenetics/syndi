Standards of Contributing
=========================

So that Auto 4 may maintain consistency, usability, and functionality,
we ask that all contributions to Auto 4 conform with a few standards and
conventions.

While this is solely a requirement for contributions to Auto 4, we would
suggest following it whenever extending or modifying Auto, whether your
intention is to ship your code upstream, release it independently, or
merely keep for your own personal use.

Moreover, to further the philosophy of free software, while we do not
demand it, we do ask that you publish code you write for Auto.

**Documentation**

Auto maintains thorough documentation. Please document your code employing rdoc
and YARD standards. 

When using the `@author` tag, please provide your GitHub
username at minimum.

**Formatting**

For indentation, ensure that you use spaces in lieu of tabs, two to be exact.

Vim users, observe the modelines each file contains:

    # vim: set ts=4 sts=2 sw=2 et:

**Language**

In documentation, commit messages, and other such things, we require compliance
with these three rules:

1. No obscene language.
2. It must be legible.
3. It must be grammatically correct at least to a reasonable degree.
