Upgrade Syndi 3 to 4
===================

Summary
-----------
Syndi 3 was a comprehensive release of Syndi, and is currently available from 
[Arinity](https://github.com/arinity/Syndi). As all things should hopefully improve
however, this fourth major revision was begun.

Nonetheless, we recognize that it is essential that we provide a means by which
Syndi users may upgrade their old configuration files and databases to function
with Syndi 4.

We intend to address this matter when Syndi 4 is nearer stability.
