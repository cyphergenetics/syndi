Upgrade Auto 3 to 4
===================

Summary
-----------
Auto 3 was a comprehensive release of Auto, and is currently available from 
[Arinity](https://github.com/arinity/Auto). As all things should hopefully improve
however, this fourth major revision was begun.

Nonetheless, we recognize that it is essential that we provide a means by which
Auto users may upgrade their old configuration files and databases to function
with Auto 4.

We intend to address this matter when Auto 4 is nearer stability.
