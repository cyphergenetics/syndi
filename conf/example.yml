# Database configuration
#
# Auto uses Redis for its database management, because it is the system we
# thought most apropos to our minimalist philosophy.
#
# There is a wiki page on this: https://github.com/Auto/Auto/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Database
#
# All of these are commented because the defaults are typically desirable.
database:

  # This will disable database functionality. We discourage this.
  #disable: yes

  # If your Redis server is listening on a host other than the 'localhost'
  # default, specify it here.
  #address: '10.0.1.1'

  # If it is listening on a port other than 6379, specify it here.
  #port: 6500

  # If it is using a UNIX socket, provide the path here.
  #path: '/tmp/redis.sock'

  # If a password is required, specify it here.
  #password: insecurepassword123

  # To use a different database from the default (0), specify its number here.
